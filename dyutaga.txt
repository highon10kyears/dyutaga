[color=yellow]Some call her the Daughter of the Khan. Some call her little more than an egotistical bastard. Some call her the Thunder of the Gods-- but, at risk of being struck down, all call her [b]Thin Lizzy[/b].

Dyutaga was born under unexceptional circumstances. During her time as a general, her mother was quite promiscuous; oppressive as the regime may have been, its rulers were never willing to extend their moral regulation to sexual activity-- partially beacuse they knew it would only draw aggression from a people already forced to accept deep aggression against its freedom, and partially because many of its own highest officials were notable for their own extensive conquests, and would rather simply allow everyone their own freedom rather than face death should their abuses become known to their most fervrent (and, oftentimes, murderous) followers.

Thus, during her conquest of the Emerald Isles, the military officer who would give birth to our 'protagonist' met the subject of her fling-- a dedicated and loyal soldier raised under the country they were currently in the process of crushing, who had turned and defected to the regime long before they started their war. He stayed, and raised the young daughter that resulted, in the absence of her mother, who was conveniently reassigned roughly ten months after her arrival on the front lines. 

Dyutaga's resentment stewed only for a short time before it boiled over into crippling angst; by the time she reached adolescence, she was in and out of town prisons and constantly being 'escorted' back home, oftentimes after committing brutal assaults on peers that insulted her relation to a then-unpopular figure in the regime. At her father's behest, she entered the regime's military before she turned 18, with the alternative being spending 20 years in prison.

Figuring she would spend six years in the service and disappear, the young woman was surprised to find herself a rather comfortable niche in fighting war, a niche she stayed in for nearly fourteen years. [small]More on that later.[/small]
